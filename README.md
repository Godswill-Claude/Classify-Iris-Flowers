# Classify-Iris-Flowers
This project involves creating six machine learning models to classify each flower in the iris dataset into one of three species using the attributes given, pick the best with the highest accuracy, and deploy the model for use

## Dataset
The iris dataset was used. The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimeters. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species. You can learn more about this dataset on Wikipedia.

## Tools/Application Softwares Used
The python programming language, along with libraries like sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc. was used

## Key Insights for Analysis/Investigation
To find out which of the six models gives the highest accuracy with the classification task.

## Summary of Findings
The SVM model turned out to be the most accurate model, achieving an accuracy of 96%. It was deployed and used to make the final prediction.
